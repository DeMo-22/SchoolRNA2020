***

After a first day about RNA-seq overview, the remainder of the School will focus on group mini-projects.

We will work with 4 topics and there will be 2 groups of 4 participants for each topic. The groups will be composed in advance, based on a survey the applicants will complete. There will be about 2 tutors per project.

The last day, the groups will present their project.

For the full schedule, please go to: **[Schedule](schedule.md)**

***

At the end of this school, the participants should be able to:
- have a good understanding of the most common methods of RNA-seq analysis,
- repeat the same type of analysis achieved during the mini-project,
- present the mini-project and more globally disseminate their experience to the members of their group.

**Pre-requisites - background knowledge**
- Previous experience with RNA-seq analysis
- Familiar with command line and UNIX language (link to a UNIX tutorial)
- Basic usage of R / Ability to use packages and modules and write analysis scripts in R ??

**Pre-requisites - material & software**
- The participants must bring a laptop with install permissions (admin). The following software have to be installed in advance: (would you please complete the list?)
